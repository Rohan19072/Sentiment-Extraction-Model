"The best smartphone money can buy! After using Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra for quite a bit as a daily driver and coming back to Samsung after a long time after using other smaller form factor phones like ONEPLUS 9, here's what I think about this phone.PROS:- This phone has the best camera ever installed into a smartphone, hands-down! No other phone made in human history can ever come close to 1% of what Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's cameras can do.- Performance is crazy! Not only it has Snapdragon 8Gen-2, but that too custom-made for Samsung Galaxy phones. You can play any games, run any apps and do whatever you'd want from a phone that is used at work, gaming, taking photos/videos and for personal use at the same time.- Rectangular form factor of this phone makes it so much comfortable and easy to hold. And it looks very premium too, which obviously is expected from a phone that costs this much.- OneUI has so many great features that they cannot be listed in one place. It brings a whole new meaning to ""smart"" in smartphones. Previously only Apple was making real smartphones that were actually smart and now with OneUI 5.1, Samsung has joined the league and probably done a better job than Apple at this point.- Good Lock modules + OneUI 5.1 has such a tremendous level of customization in terms of many aspects of the usability. It doesn't have all of it, to which I'll come in ""CONS"" section.- Charging time is good, reverse charging and wireless charging are such a sweet add-on that helps and makes the experience really good.- S-Pen does the wonders! Very useful specially for those who use their phone for professional work like eSigning and other precision work.- Build quality and software are really premium, you'll know you've sold a kidney when you hold this phone in your hands and turn up the max resolution on display.- S23 Ultra is slightly more flat on sides as compared to S22 Ultra which makes it a more usable phone.CONS:- Now, since this phone has a curved display which adds no usability but makes it little difficult to use for people with smaller hands or to reach to corners with one hand, it becomes little hard to get used to this kind of display even if you've used a curved display phone with smaller form factor before because S23 Ultra is HUGE!- Another issue with curved screen, since there's a decent curve in screen, finding a screen protector is really hard! Tempered glasses don't fit well, they get spaced by covers/cases, Samsung officially doesn't make tempered glass for S23 Ultra. Samsung sells a thin membrane sheet for ₹1,500/- which has a cutout for camera and collects dust. Having no screen protection means having your second kidney at risk too!- No charger in the box (ugh) and the cable that comes with it is really flimsy. Doesn't look like it came with a flagship phone. ONEPLUS makes 10x better cables so better buy one from them.- A phone this expensive should have all the necessary features right? But the OneUI 5.1 doesn't come with an app lock. Samsung Secure Folder is nice but not usable for a day-to-day use. Secure Folder is fine for hiding images and apps but not convenient for daily access. There's no Good Lock module to have app lock either.- OneUI 5.1 (unlike many other UIs like OxygenOS 13 and ColorOS 13) doesn't give option to rename apps in app drawer. Ability to use 3rd party icon packs just came recently. And installing a 3rd party launcher kind of ruins the UI for recent apps screen.- OneUI 5.1 requires installation of a 3rd party Good Lock module to even configure what icons will appear on your navigation bar.- Overall this is a really good phone, best I'd say! But OneUI 5.1 lacks some basic features which should've been implemented.- But other than these minor software issues and some hardware inconveniences, this phone is definitely a recommendation."
"After 1 month of this review, Mine 8gb,256gb varient purchase after 1 month Someone says this phone cant perform in battery well lag blah blah...Dont care about creepy words just You use it then speak it...Once am charge its battery is very good See the screenshots i charge 1 or 2am at night, 8am office Solidly its give around 8 or 9pm with 15 percentage charge Am not heavy user its good for me...Smooth...Butter... Comfortable in hand No weight...i dont know in camera am not a camera lovers Samung only gives 4 yrs of os and 5 yrs ofsecurity patch ,Nowadays oneplus also say this os updates i think Its for sale purpose but Samsung say years ago for this software updates....finallyBattery backup is very good *Note:its only 3900mahBattery is slow its okay i will do my things 😅Less weightComfortable in handPowerful chipStereo speakersCharger and cases separately buy is totally messedUltrasonic sensor finger printDisplay is always best for samsung mainly in s23 seriesAdaptive refreshingInculding chinese phones give App lock,screenshot gestures,background play but Samsung...Nothing to give oh...CreepyThis my user experience if u are normal user go for it...Best choice upto 2027."
"Good phone , compared for pixel 7 pro and apple 14 pro. I was samsung follower sing samsung galaxy series,  bit last time purchased google pixel 7pro 256gb. And found that it was good phone but no call recorder,  and it's camera was best then I compared my pixel with S23ultra and found there was not that much difference yes pixel camera was a bit good but I am not that professional or like that but found that apart from camera everything else is best in samsung s23ultra ..Also there was in built "" Call recorder "" which I always needed and that was main point where pixel was lagging behind .... and also found samsung galaxy s23ultra way more fast and efficient than pixel also there was no heating issue like pixel in this samsung galaxy s23 ultra....also I was never apple fan and never found it worth compared samsung, used apple 14 ,apart from camera where there may be difference of 0.5% between samsung and apple camera apple is over hyped and not a value for money phone and also you can't run multiple apps in background in apple and no call recorder also there is no back button or symbol in apple it's random some times you swipe it sometime some app has cross symbol in any corner that you have to search....better go for samsung it's always value for money. This review is not paid I have used all three master phones apple 14 pro, pixel and now samsung s23ultra....found S23 ultra to be the winner."
"The perfect beast This phone is a pefect upgrade from my old One plus. I had to make a hard choice between s22 and s23. I came to the conclusion that processor used in s22 (Snapdragon 8 gen 1) is inefficient. Infact it was one of the most inefficient processors produced by snapdragon+samsung in last 5 years in premium segment. That combined with low battery was just worse. So I decided to spend more money for this phone. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is an actual successor of snapdragon and gives enormous battery life.After first charge, I was getting 8 hours SOT. Which is double from my old Oppo Oneplus (Haha). Plus I got upgrade on the first day, using 120 hz refresh rate with light performance mode while battery set to adaptive. I think I can push for 10 hour screen-on-time if I want to.Screen is perfect, samsung right now is the biggest supplier of screens in mobile market, so that's no doubt. Speakers are stereo and have dolby digital mode. The UI is top tier, samsung right now has the best UI in the market. The amazing things is the bloatware are so well integrated into samsung ecosystem that it doesn't even feel like bloatware. I am using samsung internet/notes instead of chrome and google keep. There is also a vapor chamber in base variant of s23, which you will not find in s22. Ram booster was turned on by default, giving me 8 GB of virtual RAM but I turned it off because I heard it reduces performance. All medium-end games run at 120 FPS, and samsung has their own app for real time monitoring. You will also get 6 months spotify premium (from Amazon) and 4 months of youtube premium (from samsung) with this.I use spigen ultra hybrid case with Glazedinc tempered glass. Protip - Glazedinc.com tempered glass is compatiable with fingerprint sensor. I use their s23 tempered glass-real curved which works perfectly and costed me around ₹675 (not sponsored).Phone is expensive and price should be set around 65K, but samsung is trying to become apple of android world. Whats worse is discount is there, but they will not give it to you directly, you have to use 3 different discounts to lower the MRP which is a scummy behaviour from Samsung. No reason to give additional 7K exchange bonus, if MRP itself was lowered by 7K. Also bank credit card discount are insane (around 8K). This will bring MRP in the range of 60K instead of 75K. My point is to give discount directly instead of bypassing it from somewhere. Also availing warranties and sales after service is bad, I still have to manually find out about youtube premium membership because samsung never mentioned it anywhere.So, this is the best phone is premium segment apart from s23 ultra. If you are looking for a handy premium smartphone and can't manage big screen on s23 ultra, this is the way to go.Edit 1. People should not use Samsung Smart switch to restore their data to new phone. I have heard it reduces battery life. Instead manually copy photos, contacts everything etc.Edit 2. Moonshots on higher model i.e. s23 ultra are kinda fake since it uses ai scene optimizer to place a picture of moon on real moon. But nothing to worry about this model.Edit 3. Don't use samsung smart switch to transfer files to your new phone. It is bugged and keeps draining battery. Manually transfer big files. If you had used it, you can factory reset your phone if you notice your battery life is not up to the mark. I didn't use smart switch and easily got 8 hours."
Worst Fingerprint sensor Awesome camera and features but fingerprint sensor sucks. It always fails to read fingerprint and says fingerprint doesnt match. Phone unlocks in 3rd or 4th try everytime.
"Well rounded decent phone from Samsung Writing this review after 1 month of using this device. Phone is pretty good when it comes to build quality, feels premium. Software experience has been good so far no bugs, smooth UI. The main issue i have had with this phone is battery backup, it doesn't last whole day. Gives about 6-7 hours of screen on time on wifi and 5 hours on mobile data. Battery performance could have been better as Samsung's mid-range phones are really good at battery backup. When it comes to camera day time pics are damn good but feels little over-saturated, night mode pics are not that great feels over-exposed almost all the time."
S23 Plus is worth 95K Satisfied 80% with Battery. All else are exceptional and Camera is too good and that's the reason I buy this phone. Hope Battery will get improved over updates
"Fastest android in the market. When it comes to the Galaxy S23 Ultra's outstanding capabilities, the camera is merely the tip of the iceberg. The gadget is really quick and has a potent CPU that can easily handle even the most taxing programmes and games. With its spectacular 6.8-inch Dynamic display, which offers stunning images and vivid colours that make everything from streaming video to browsing the web enjoyable, the device is truly stunning."
"I like it.. but not love it. I bought it a week ago.. i upgraded  from my oneplus 6, I used that phone for 4.5 yrs. I was confused between oneplus 11 and samsung 23, after thoroughly going through reviews from experts. I zeroed on this phone,.. I like the phone no doubt. The haptics are nice and UI is smooth.But i dont know why i m facing connectivity issues in this phone. Being a flagship phone, it should  have better connectivity.. but it sucks..websites do not open, both wifi and mobile networks have some kind of bug. I am unable to use internet, i have to constantlyrefresh and restart my device for better network. I am getting  missed calls alerts via sms although  mobile network shows full strength..I think samsung should look into this. its very irritating. Never faced this issue in my 4.5 yrs old oneplus 6."
Quality and compact phone Good phone and features but price little high
Battery capacity Ok ok
"Battery capacity bit low, bit overpriced to competition I felt screen size and battery could have been improved. Heats up after 15 mins of gaming. Not recommended for heavy phone users with more than 5 hours of SOT. Also, built-in Samsung apps hangs sometimes."
"Best Phone One Can Buy This is my first Samsung  phone. I shifted from One plus 10 to Galaxy S23 ultra and I must say it is the best decision I made to switch for S23 ultra. Great picture quality, super fast processing, build quality is perfect. Camera is the best."
Galaxy S23 5G The phone is working fine. Very compact and sturdy. Very fast operations.  Take two 5g Sims. The key pad is very small and is difficult to type for persons with comparatively bigger fingers.
Love it..!! 1. Great camera. Portraits and raw photos are extremely good.2. In hand experience is very good.3. Screen size is perfect. Screen quality is also pretty nice.
S 23 ultra Overall super
"Best compact phone with all premium features Phone does the job, with all the features working as expected, camera has shutter lag, but samsung has told they will release the update related to camera 🤞, battery is decent for normal usage. While setting up faced heating issues after that not faced any issues, more than 2 weeks over. Fingerprint not detecting most of the times with screen protector.Overall enjoyed the phone."
"Super and powerful phone Without any second thought it's the most beautiful, powerful and stable android phone."
"Buttery creamy performance-best compact phone I bought the cream version and it looks very premium. Was in dilemma whether to buy Oneplus 11 which was costing around 55k. But got this gadget at 56k with exchange bonus which was icing on the cake.Coming to phone, the battery life is decent . I Get only around 5 hrs SOT /17 hrs  in total till battery life and I have very high usage like excel, chrome, and social media apps. Dont play games , so dont know the performance. But its buttery smooth .Outdoor brightness is exceptional. It is joy to watch videos on this on display.Camera is also excellent with very good portraits and night time shots with 60fps recording .Only con is slow charging , should have given 45 w charging option, 25W is slow and also the battery dies from 5% to 1% within like 5 mins."
Top G of all Androids This is an absolute beast of a phone with exceptional performance and battery life. The display and the cameras are top tier and there is not a single thing that you can complain about.
"Awesome 😎 Pros: excellent look and feel , I've always wanted this compact mobile since iPhone 6 .Display is awesome , battery is cool , UI is smooth and I can say this is the best Android Mobile as of today (Mar 2023)Cons : Getting warm up sometimes , battery size could have been better , just 25 watt fast charging and price is quite high (I opted for exchange )Over all , it's more useful and productive usage"
"Best Android phone yet. Everything is great except battery. Best Android phone yet. Everything is great except battery. Cameras, display, performance everything is super great but the battery lasts only 8-12 hrs max. I upgraded my android from Samsung M51 (7000mah battery) to this S23 (3900 mah battery) and I love everything except the battery in my new phone. Otherwise the phone is just great. OneUI latest version is also pretty good now. Go for it but beware of the battery!!"
5 star Very good  phone
great phone for the camera lovers. i used it for more than a month now. Its just awesome for camera lovers who likes zooming and love to make reels. I made many reels with this phone. Those are superb. Just check my instagram page of sameer_abbas88 for the videos.
"Satisfied So far, everything is excellent. Nothing to complain about. Battery life, camera , display, UI, everything is top notch."
"Best android iPhone 😉 I am using Samsung brand more than 10 years and this is first time I see Samsung has improved a lot. No lags, superfast phone, superfast charging, super display, many features, best camera. That's why I said android iPhone 😄Just one thing battery should be 4500mah for small size S23 that will last long. While using camera, battery drains superfast and mobile temperature goes up and up."
Phone is great Phone is great with performance but battery life is poor and the phone which I received was having a slight screen leakage but I was not able to replace it so it's fine now
Competes with an Apple Never was a Android user but gifted this to wife. It's just an amazing phone. Camera is too good.
"Product was good,  but amazon service was worst in worst ever. Product was good,  but amazon service was worst in worst ever."
"Premium Feeling Amazing phone, Camera &AI is superb. Face Unlocking sensor is More faster. Cooling system much better than other devices. No heating effect. Don't expect moon photos but you will get premium phone feeling.."
Value for money Best picture qualityFast charging missing
S23 One Best android phone.. Super Batery.. Best Camera and Beast performance.
"Galaxy s23 Excellent performance..but sometimes heating issue arrived..90min take for full charge with Samsung 45watt super fast charger..Camara quality good but not like iphone 14..i buy this with good exchange price rs 57,000/-..8gb 256 variant.."
"Recommended Buy Excellent overall Phone.All day battery life unless you are a Gamer.Good quality speakers with Dolby AtmosSamsung Samoled screen unbeatable in terms of screen.Great build quality.One UI - it's amazing.Handle tons of apps like a breeze - me being a power user couldn't slow it down even after keeping almost 30 apps running in background.45W Samsung charger - The cherry on the top, charges entire phone in 1hr some mins.Net picking - Charging cable could have braided for  durability"
"Fantastic Phone - Best Compact Phone Period. This is probably the best 6.1 inch phone your money can buy and most premium phone in android. I am sure it will beat apple too in value for money.Got this phone for 50,800 after all the discount and exchanging my Oneplus 7T.* Build quality is just strong with aluminum frame and gorilla glass victus on both sides.* Display is full HD and is very pleasing to use. This is the best brightness I have experienced with 1750 nits. 120hz makes the user experience so fluid.* Storage of 256GB with UFS 4.0 and 8GB RAM makes the phone usage buttery smooth.* Cameras are top notch and software does a great job is delivering brilliant pictures.* BATTERY !! Yay this is the best part of this phone and what it can deliver with combination of QCOM Snadragon 8 gen 2 and 3900mah battery. The battery can most likely last 2 days for most common use cases.* Software experience has been improved with one UI and feels great. The updates are provided for 5 years which is longest in android world.Overall definitely recommend this phone as its the best compact android phone in 2023 your money can buy especially with all the discounts its pure value for money.Samsung nailed it with S23 series this year. Kudos !!"
Great Camera Product is like OK.Camera is awesome.Battery backup bit low.
The real flagship with a cute and handy design The best android phone I have ever used. It would have been better if the battery was a little larger
"9.5 hours of SOT Battery life is just crazy good , got 9.5 hours of SOT from 100 to 5% , with mixed usage it will last 1.5 to 2 days. Let it take some time to learn your usage patterns.UI is butter smooth."
"Fantastic Awesome mobile, very good battery life and very high end performer"
"Camera and performance with compact design Its camera performance battery everything is great and it comes with a compact design. I had a doubt about the battery and its heating problem, but now there is nothing like that.It has all the features that should be in today's device, But for this you also have to pay a good amount.And it also delivers good value compared to last year's s22.So whoever wants to get a compact flagship smartphon, this is best option if he does not want to get an iPhone."
Good Device but not the best ProsGood Display.Performance & Battery life is okay for normal day to day tasksPotrait shots are goodCons:Camera has shutter lagLacks details on indoor shots and human face shots
"Great product but dodgy exchange process. There was no apparent body damage. However, delivery agent charged us for body damage"
Real flagship Very nice design. Battery SOT around 6 hours. Too good performance. I am very satisfied with this overall phone
Samsung Galaxy s23 It's a masterpiece.
One of the best phone!!! Camera is not upto the mark!!!
Best size phone but expensive The size of the phone is perfect and best for daily jeans wared person and easily fit in skin fit jeans alsoBut the price is very high as compared to its competitors.
"So far so good Camera too good. Display is dope af. Feels super nice to hold. Flagship experience all around. One small con is the camera arrangement, one below the other, hand touches the cam sometimes, will get used to it in a few days, plus and ultra won't have this issue because the size is bigger I guess. Battery is just decent but still way better than s22.Cam performance drops dramatically indoors or when light is low, even in the morning. Could use night mode to get better pictures. Relies a lot on post processing of the image. Sometimes images feels too HDRish without having hdr turned on. Pretty sure future updates could make the camera much better. In bright light both front and back cameras are amazing. 4k 60fps videos are too fiire, screenshots from video will look as good as standalone images. Ton of detail. Stabilization is excellent. Slo mo is fun too."
"Superfast and very big Switched from iPhone 12 pro max to S23 Ultra for some reason. S23 Ultra is superfast, stylish and has very big screen but feeling somewhat inconvenient who used to iPhone. No regret for buying."
Compact Flagship Phone Pros:Very handy to useGood cameraBetter battery lifeLooking very premiumCons:Finger print is not reading properly after the screen guard installation (Using spigen screen guard)
Beast Battery life is amazing... best flagship from Samsung
Nice Good mobile . I m happy with s23
"Pure magic. Don't buy if you play heavy games. It's not a gaming phone. Rest of the phone is pure magic. The size, camera, audio, battery, performance, everything. You won't be able to go back to a large phone after this."
Awesome Phone Worth Buying!! Awesome camera quality and fastest processor ever. 😊😊
"Great Mobile Cameras, Display, Build, In-hand feel, speaker, battery great.Fingerprint is also great without screen guard, with can cause problems.Battery is good for normal use, but while using camera it drains fast, point to remember.UI is very smooth, never saw frame drops.All this after using for 15+ daysWorth every penny, great if u get under 60k"
"Excellent phone from Samsung Amazing phone from Samsung this time. Performance is superb and no heating issues. Battery performance is also improved, it will last you whole day with moderate use. Software is smooth and lag free. Camera is next level, night performance is very good. Compact size and easy to use. If you can get it within 60k then best deal in flagship category.Go for it."
"In A League Of Its Own 😍 Its a phone which is nearly peerless, don't think twice if you have the budget."
"Very much satisfied Good work done by Samsung again. Compact, light and almost bezel less, very easy to use."
Good high-end phone You can feel the power of the latest SD processor. Its a great alternative to iPhone for sure.
"That this is a medium sized phone in relation to huge unbearable phones in the market. I liked almost every aspecf of this phone. It is premium,easy to hold considering the screen size ,reminds me of iPhone 5s but that was smaller. Slick,  swift and perfectly configured. I might say that this phone looks even better than some of the iPhonesin the market (of course those are way more premium and well put together). I think Samsung got jt all right this time as the elegant flat back and a very neutral design in the front with perfectly matched camera and refresh rates and the chip..display and camera  have been the forte but they went one notch up by making the phone look and shine of quality ."
Just go for it!! (Bs Naam se iPhone nhi h) Battery: on average use i got 14 to 15 hrs of Battery life and 6+ hrs of screen on time. Generally it would be sufficient for one day to use (morning to evening). [Okayish]Camera: its fantastic. Portrait mode at 3x is unbelievable i don't think even iphone can compete(Reference attached). Image processing is outstanding and you'll get tons of premium post editing features like object eraser etc. [No competition]Display: Its Samsung's Display so no comment needed. [Sexy dikhta h]In Hand feel: Bahut halka and grippy h. Premium feel aati h. Recently one of my friend bought iphone 14 pro we both found that very bulky and uncomfortable for long use. [best one hand friendly in market]Final verdict-: agar aapke mathe pe iphone k naam ka bhoot swar nhi h to S23 is a best deal for you. It has tons of premium practical features that no iphone can provide you. I accept people buy iphone for public appearance but if Samsung get that brand value then no iphone can compete S23.Edited: Superfast 5G support and very good HD call quality. No issues with mobile network found.
Camera and performance is great. I've noticed that the finger print sensor isn't working after installing a screen protector. I set face unlock but it's unlocking the device after multiple attempts. I hope samsung will fix these issues in security update.
"The Beast in all the sense🔥🔥🔥 After around 4.5 years of extensive one plus 6T usage, finally I decided go for a new phone and did a pre-booking of Samsung s23 ultra.Here I am writing this review with no regrets on my decision ever. Very happy with the one UI experience, super smooth OS and performance, extensive battery life ,unbeatable camera quality, Display and gaming experience. Just go for it guys if you don't have a budget barrier."
"Big package, small size Upgraded from Samsung M33. Samsung UI, small size, SD 8 Gen 2, Awesome display, Pro grade camera biggest USPs in the phone. Battery life is average. But cant complain as its just 3900 mAh. Turn on adaptive battery, power saving routine during sleep AOD off, will easily last for 6 hours SOT. Fast and responsive. Even on light performance mode where processing is limited to about 70%, its quick and no lag. 8 gb ram is very optimized."
"Best in the class Switched from MI 11x and i can definitely say that you will feel the difference as soon as you hold the phone. Would recommend to definitely switch to samsung if you are using the likes of mi, vivo, oppo and if your are planning to buy this phone. You will definitely love it."
Durability is really great Durability of phone is really good. I don't usually write review.. but experience of this phone is so great that had made me write this review. Go for it without any thinking of you are looking for compact allrounder phone
Super phone Battery is not adequate
"Happy with the phone & price  but not with the exploitation of the features The looks , feel and balance is perfect ! Performance satisfactory for the past 2 months. The phone however lacks a proper utilisation manual and therefore, I am certain 90% of the users are not exploiting the phone, much beyond 50 % ! A training manual is a must a hard copy or soft copy ! Though this is a common problem with all medium to high end smartphones!"
Very Nice Samsung S23 ultra looks stunning but improve better
"Best Compact Flagship Great CameraGreat displayGreat Battery Life - It will take about 1 week to  learn the usage pattern, after that battery life will see improvement. I tested with adaptive battery and light performance mode and 100% to 7% gave me 7h 40m sot using numerous apps and 1d 6h total with 2h 33m remaining.Once you properly opmitize the phone, you can get the most out of it. Played Genshin Impact and it was awesome and no heating issues as well.4 years of os updates and 5 years of security updates."
Good compact Android phone. Yes you can take moon shots with this phone too.. The AI does the processing but still it's a moon shot. Battery backup is as sufficient for a compact phone like this. You can increase it with more restrictive settings like performance to lite and display refresh rate to 60Hz. But we don't spend this much money to restrict like this right? Without doing these things am still getting 1 whole day battery backup. Am a moderate user. Camera is awesome. Processing speed is great.Two things that I have to get adjusted after changing from OnePlus 6 is Fast charging and Headphone/Bluutooth audio output.
Awesome experience Baught 256gb under 50k after exchanging my phone. Awesome phone.I don't see significant improvement in camera with older generation. But It is most secure Android phone with lots of feature such as ultrasonic fingerprint and with samsung wallet you do not need to carry your physical document or plastic money with you.
In one word premium Its the apple of android pure premium experience and mesmerizing display.
Best Mobile phone Best mobile i have ever used
Excellent phone A sleek phone compared to the Fold series and as capable
Everything is good except Primary camera issue Mos of the s23 devices are facing banagate camer blurr issue where when you take some picture on the left and bottom side you will see camer blurr you can notice mainly on images that has text on it
"Galaxy S23 Ultra Superb performance, amazing camera..hope future updates can improve battery life"
Awesome everywhere Bought it after replacing S22 ultra trusted samsung one more time with this so far its good ...the biggest complain of 22Ultra  i.e. battery life is no longer in this one...Photos also looks quite impoved since 22Ultra..Edit :- battery life is crazy good 10 hours of SOT with Quad Hd resolution and 120Hz and dark theme my S22 ultra was at 30% just after 5 hrs of SOT loving it will use 23 ultra atleast for 3 years
Exceptionally convenient Phone Exceptionally convenient phone and quite powerful. Sad they dont provide atleast a nornal charger with it
"Just go for it No complaints so far. Awesome battery and fabulous camera. The phone looks and feels premium.Pro tip: The exchange program with Amazon is much more hassle free and smooth. So if you are planning to exchange ur phone, go with Amazon rather than Flipkart, if you have the option."
"FAR BEHIND THAN OTHER CHEAPER PHONES EXCEPT CAMERA heating issue is prime, battery drains fast."
Best phone under 90k Everything about this phone is good except the fingerprint reader. Its work as a charm without screen protector but with screen protector it takes 3 -4 tries.
Superb Perfect  phone  in every expect
"Compact and powerful 1. Very compact phone, if you switch from 6.5 inch to this you might feel this is small. Might take time to get adjusted to this.2. Battery life is good but not as excellent as claimed by reviewers. Install all your required apps and check the idle drain at Nighy, it's about 6%.3. Camera is excellent, both front and back. Low light photo is also good.4. The camera module is projecting out, so be careful during usage. Decent case should solve the issue.5. Screen display is very good6. Sound is awesome with dolby support7. Finger print sensor is slightly buggy, which might be fixed in updates.Exchange:1. Exchange process was so smooth. No hassle.After discount and Exchange effective price is 54k as of 1 March 2023"
"Best phone by samsung Always wondered when samsung will ditch Exynos for Snapdragon for Flagship phones, and finally Snapdragon for Galaxy, no over heating and better optimised phone, battery last almost 36 to 48 hours with normal usage,  I miss the curve edge but it has his own advantage but rest features compensate enough...Thanx Sammy n Amz for the beasty product"
"Just the best to get, only lacking in charging speed Pros: Device is compact with good build quality and a minimalistic look, has excellent set of camerasCons: Could have had faster charging speed"
Amazing phone I am using samsung galaxy S23 since 30 days.Phone is awasome specially camera.
Pricey one but best Samsung phone yet You can buy it if you can afford it but be sure to protect it as it comes with hefty price. If you are coming from iPhone and want to copy all photos then do it at the time of setting up. I found the battery is regular if we clone iPhone data. If we setup as a fresh phone then it may give good battery life.
Superb... மொபைல் பட்டைய கிளப்புது....!!!!
"Best budget flagship Got 256gb one for 55k after exchange and discount. Good deal.Very smooth, processor does the job, camera is great, battery optimisation is awesome in this."
"In Love with This Phone 😍❤️ I switched from iPhone 12 to this beast.....Believe me guys this phone is on another level...I was having few other options like 14 pro max , pixel 7 pro , one plus 11 , s23 ultra....after doing a full research I decided to buy this beast...and here I am happy with my decision 😇😇"
Super quality 👌 Picture Qulity is super .Very smooth
Best 6.1 inch mobile in the market. Everything is excellent except battery life. Getting battery life for 7 hrs sot and 1 day with full charge for normal usage like browsing and playing videos.Gave 4 stars because of battery life.
Excellent smartphone Excellent smartphone
Display Display size very good
"Compact iphone alternative This is my first flagship Samsung device.  Prior to this I was using Samsung A52s. I also have a iphone 13. The size is almost exactly the same. If you examine closely, the body of the S23 feels a bit narrower. In my brief usage I am experiencing some heating but I think it will sort out after a few days.  Phone is definitely smooth even though I am restricting usage to lite mode. The haptic feedback is okay but not as remarkable as I was expecting after my usage of Nothing Phone 1 and iphone but its not bad either,I just had more expectation. I have received this phone after exchanging My A52s at ₹15,250/- and the exchange process of Amazon was much easier than what I have experienced with flipkart's exchange.Overall,I am quite satisfied with the purchase."
"Sleek and handy Great phone. Fast, elegant.  Fits in hand for single hand use. Not at all bulky."
"Best in Android!! Finally an Android phone which can give iPhone a run for money, excellent specs, Fantastic camera... There are so features which are not talked about.. Samsung needs to market better compared to IPhone... I am quite satisfied with the phone."
Very good Very good
"Be careful while purchasing online/exchange program even though seller is renowned Phone is good in all aspect. Fingerprint, battery, camera is excellent but during exchange and buying online be careful as seller may sell clone/OEM product even though they are renowed for there service. I got phone on time but fingerprint stop working in 12 days  when visited I got new phone from offline store in exchange of online product by intervention of service center. Great and very helpful service by Samsung Service center."

 I would love the camera quality 9f this phone. I am Attaching few photos which I took in one of the marriage in night.Talking about the Batterry- Easily one day with very heavy uses.Speed- snapdragon 8th gen 2 with extra clock is so much smooth and no lag in last 1 week. I have installed heavy games and my official apps as well. Till now it's like charm no si gle lag I have observed. Earlier was using one plus 9 and now jumped on to this device from one plus to flagship samsung. I can proudly that it was a wise decision.Charging speed is also very good. Your phone will take approx 1.3 hour to charge full. Ons- only one cons is no Charger with the phone  but you will get good discounts on cards so you can use thT for Charger. Other then that I am very happy with over all performance."
"I wished for an iphone like hardware with android.. Samsung heard it !! Upgraded from galaxy note 9 to this tiny flagship. I  was done with the bulk of a large phone and needed a one hander this time.Its just perfect.Camera - so far so good, 3x is amazing.Battery - goodDisplay - excellentSpeed - swift and superb.Its premium feel is top notch and is comparable to that of iphone pro lineup."
Best phone ever Phone is very smooth and camera picture quality is excellent...Battery performance  one and half day it will last and fingerprint reader works well... worth buying this phone..
Best phone like iphone Really great phone to use
Samsung S23 value for money Best camera for vlog suite battery is very improved
"The best android phone in the market right now. But a bit overpriced. The phone is no doubt the best phone in the world right now.Display, camera,performance everything is top notch. Battery backup is also very good. But it is overpriced. Shouldve been under 100k since it is manufactured in india only."
Best compact device out there. It's a great device for those who want a compact smartphone with every best possible thing in a smartphone. the in-hand feel is just amazing and the fluidityis just at par with any flagship costing 1 lakh plus.The best thing is the display in my opinion.
"A galaxy in itself! The media could not be loaded.
                



 Wish they made more phones like the s23!For people who like small and sleek phones this is an absolute must have!There will always be something that's a bit off in any premium phones but as far as my recollection for this device, there's nothing such (for me atleast).The design, the camera (AND THE CAMERA PLACEMENTS!!!!!), the processor, the battery, the super fast charging, the ui and everything else about this phone is brilliance in itself. Samsung has really outdone itself in every department here and I love that a big brand really listens and makes devices that cater to an audience.  I did not have to think twice before getting this one. Way to go Samsung, you got me hooked!!!Edit: Night photography and astrophotography is just 🫶"
Best Supper
Best of the best 👌 Guy's please stop comparing this phone with iPhone. This phone is much much better phone than the iPhone.Everything is good about this phone.
"Words amazing handy phone best class camera, best class battery backup....thanks Samsung... No problem all designs best. A little bit disappointed. Change power 45 wott is best option possible. 👌"
Not as expected.. Too much heating.Photo quality reflects Chinese quality. Not good as seen in review. Should have bought iPhone instead.
"Great compact powerhouse of a Phone Back is bit slippery and glass so using skin but the feel, finish and comfort is incomparabl"
"Premium experience is what you pay for I am already using a s23 and bought this one because of all the praise it's receiving. Have to say that the reviews are almost right about this phone. But I honestly feel that for half the price, vanilla s23 is a far more value for money product than this one. If you like or even okay with smaller phones, s23 just makes more sense. I bought the s23 for 46k after exchanging 3 month old moto edge 30 and s23 ultra for 87k after exchanging 4 month old pixel 6a. One thing I can assure you is that one ui is addictive"
Just superb 
"Worth it if you are okay with the size I am coming from s20 fe 5g, everything feels like an upgrade, the screen, the build,  the display, the battery, the speakers. The only think that is still taking time to get used to is the size of it, it's a huge phone, wished it was a tad smaller to like 6.3inch and it would have been in a sweet spot for one hand use. This is the phone to last for several years to come without needing any upgrades."
"Best Android phone ever + unmatched S-Pen that is useful+ Fantastic camera - best I have experienced+ Green is not my favorite color but on S23 ultra it looks awesome. Premium finish+ Big and beautiful display with thin bezels and tiny front camera hole. Great choice for OTT+ feels good and light in hand+ 5G with strong network connectivity+ Samsung UI is clean, no bloatware, Ads, and bugs.  Good customization options+ PERFORMANCE is best+ Samsung watch, earbuds, etc works well together- High price. SAMSUNG MUST MAKE THIS AFFORDABLE. At may be 80K sales can be more than 10 times- Strong competition offering better value (like 80% features at 50% price)"
"Does it worth the price? I brought this device on pre-book. waited sometime to get the device in hand. I was planning to upgrade my device (Mi 11X Pro). As to all Samsung lovers, it is a good device.+ Finger print sensor is fast+ Inbuild call recording without advertising+ Great screen body ratio. The brightness is on another level.+ Nice Audio separation.+ Adaptive refresh rate+ 4 Android version upgradable.- Not getting a premium feel (UI) even I spend around 1Lakh for a mobile! Not getting any more feature other than my Mi device costs 40k"
"Impressive phone, ticks all the boxes. After long time base model of  S series flagship is this good. Decent battery life, superb chipset with stellar efficiency with no heating. Cameras are fantastic specially selfie camera. Speaker are great as well.All in all it's a refined product with phenomenal end user experience."
All Hail Beast. All hail. No comparision
Amazing zone and excellent performance... Amazing zone and excellent performance...
Compact and powerful Bought it for general use. The camera is good and the compactness of the phone makes me feel like I am holding a iPhone. Definitely  worth it. Will serve the purpose
"Performance  wise excellent but I noticed available RAM is just 4GB even it's 8GB model. Performance  wise excellent but I noticed available RAM is just 4GB even it's 8GB model.  Not sure why it is even I have  nothing  installed, it's  just with pre-installed things."
Bang for buck Perfect flagship
A piece of art..!! One of the best small mobiles out there in the market
Best smart phone till date Upgraded from my galaxy note 9 and I am liking the performance. The camera is easily the highlight of this phone. It takes stunning photos and videos. The ultra series has kept the legacy of the note series alive by keeping the s-pen and bringing the best hardware in the market. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a flagship device with best on the market hardware
Amazing phone Excellent product
"Beast It's an awesome device by Samsung. Top notch display, camera and overall performance. Considering it's performance, battery back up is okay. Daily charging will be required."
"A tiny beast!! This phone stands out as a rare gem among all those huge ugly Chinese phones. Excellent screen, great battery, so so camera.The fingerprint sensor is a great disappointment though. Needs an immediate fix."
Good product received a brand new phone and functions are good. struggling for a charger.
Great phone Keep your charger handy
Small but compact...Beast Small in size fill good in hand .camera is great.Slightly warm when you play game .
Worth it Nice phone for professionals. Features are good. Not for heavy users.
"Mini monster Great battery life, compact size, fast af as well. Best one yet from samsung."
Only drawback it does not support all Bluetooth earphone and charger is not given... Good quality premium phone but accessories are very costly in local market
Heating issues Overall the phone is good but it has bad heating issue even on normal day to day apps. Samsung really need to work on this. The charging is also preety slow.
King is back Happily switched from iphone 13 pro max.Its a joy to hold this phone and use it.My iphone had become useless coz i was not taking pictures anymore from the iphone from the day i got S23 ultra.Best displayBest batteryBest cameraBest speakerBest softwareBest software supportBest customisation ( good lock)Best network reception
Worth Super product

 Already put my sim and writing review from this phone only so can only shoot this in front of the mirror.I am a previous note 10+ user (used iPhone 12 in between) so very glad to be back on Samsung and immersive giant screen with vivid colours. Excellent delivery from Amazon. 5star to the seller. 😍😍😍"
Great phone with enough features If you want longer battery and bigger screen than s23 but don't want to shell out 1+ lakh( for s-pen and 200mp camera) then go for this.
Charger should be give Front camera should improve little more
Comfortable handy phone Compact power packed phone.
Compact Beast Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.  It's simply 👌 with best camera and performance.
"Best Phone till date Excellent camera quality, great battery and good gaming performance. All in one package.Dex is also improved compared to s22 plus. Must buy for samsung lovers."
Awesome phone with compact size and powerful processor. Camera is excellent Awesome
Small yet powerful phone. Small yet powerful phone.
Best android phone of 2023 Best premium phone in android segment camera os battery everything is good. But efficiency of battery should improve a lot more when compared to previous version
S23 plus The best camera quality and build quality is very best battery backup is also good but one thing disappointed that you get adepter with it you have to buy it from outside.
Average Quality not as hyped by reviewers Average quality mobile not justified for the price. Camera quality poor. IPhone with 12mp Camera gives much superior photo quality. Battery life poor against 4700mah. Highly disappointed buying Samsung galaxy after using different IPhones for last 8 years and still using. Finger print reader ok but no better than IPhones.
"Bang for buck Best in display, camera, connectivity and battery.Above average in sound and OS customizations."
"Best in the market The media could not be loaded.

"Amazing Phone In Android I got this phone in much higher price, market rate is much cheaper than amazon price"
Most powerful Phone This is the best phone now available in market
Shifted from iOS to S23 Ultra I have no regrets shifting from iOS to S23 ultra.The camera Quality is the best in the market. And display is top notch.
Cute smoll phone Matches all my needs for my an ideal phone.
Mind blowing purchase Elegant looks best performance camera is good
Just fantastic!!! Really a true flagship phone. Still exploring though 😍
"Thank you Samsung and Amazon More than 2 year's I am searching for a deal who will provide all three, smartphone -smartwatch-buds with no compromise in latest technology. I think u all achive u r Target and place a milestone for other's."
Best 2023 device Perfect design & weight balance.
Nice and compact.... 
"Heats up alot else fine. It is heating up very frequently. It even heats up during very light usage. I don't even game on this phone, though phone is responsive but it even heats using Instagram or YouTube. It heats up while charging or if i put something on download.When i m on call, it gets so hot that it becomes impossible to put it on the ear.I had S20 FE earlier and that was way fine than this.Tomorrow I'm visiting service center, lets see how things unfold. I'll update here as well.Other than that it is a fine phone. Good cameras, good small size phone."
The best Android phone you can get. Top Notch Performance
No.1 Android phone 2023 Camera excellentSound speaker quality super 👌Display mind blowingOverall best mobile till now
"Battery life is not up to the mark Battery life is not up to the mark. Hardly 8 hrs and charging time is high too. Takes nearly an hour for full charge, compare it to oneplue11R which takes 10 minutes and lives for days.Samsung should work on their battery"
"Perfect phone from all aspect Display, camera, battery, UI, fingerprint reader, speaker, front camera all 10/10"
"Best phone in the market Best camera.,very good battery backup,no heating issue,very food display..you will feel like taking photo in dslr..."
Received a damaged item & for the refund its more than 15 days still waiting Received a damaged item & for the refund its more than 15 days still waiting
"First Samsung Phone and i am disappointed I really don't know why it exists for a huge price. My honest review - one plus 7T was ways better in UI and performance. There are so many glitches i found in this S23 ultra. Camera is good , software is a big no no. Performance not that great ."
"Compact phone with great camera Phone Display is brighter and picture & video quality are awesome. I exchanged my iPhone xr and purchased using samsung corporate offer which came with huge discount and bank offers.Felt Speakers volume is low compared to other phones and also battery should have been similar to a54.Apart from this , the phone performance rocks."
"Don't buy; highly disappointed Latest update after 1month use:Initial look and feel was nice but after a month my happiness was shattered. The phone is performing so bad that I am appreciating my old phone Pixel 2 even more. This phone doesnot even do basic job well, like - fingerprint scanner, face recognition, app optimisation for battery, heating.  50% of time face recognition doesn't work, fingerprint also doesn't work 30% times. This is so frustrating that I have to struggle with such basic feature for 30-40 times a day. Battery gets drained relatively faster as they don't know how to manage background apps. They recommend those frequently waking up apps like whatsapp to put in deep sleep to save battery but then u won't get whatsapp notification unless you open the app manually. Photos are not coming good, focusing doesn't work that well like in pixel2 and iPhone.Overall great disappointment given I paid same price that of an iPhone and Pixel7. A very bad decision indeed!!-------------old review-------------Old phone: Pixel 2My long wait of 4 years for a handy and light phone is over. I am very happy that I took the bet on S23. It's small (6""), light (168gm), fast, responsive, good battery life. 72k was a bit high, but otherwise it's good. Photos are not as good as Pixel 2 or iPhone due to incapable photo optimization software. But anyway, being a decent user (almost no gaming), I find it a perfect fit for my need. I was an ardent fan of Pixel phones, but latest models kept on disappointing on battery, size, and huge camera unit bump."
"CAMERA IS NOT FLAGSHIP AT ALL The camara has below major issue.1. Shutter speed is slow.2. Post processing of images is very slow.3. After post processing, 50MP sensor over saturate the photos.4. The focus is not that good.5. Even the raw photo option process the saturated photos.The 3.5 years Old One Plus 7 was taking better photos than this phone."
"Premium Compact handset Been using for more than a month, earlier was using S20FE so the data switch and replication of my settings were smooth and easy.I was worried about battery but with dual Sim in use and 4hrs of screen on time I'm getting a descent backup. Idle drain is very low compared to my S20Fe.I'm not pro in camera and pictures captured are impeccable.Device looks premium compactable in hand and is light weight in pocket."
You can boil water with this phone Heating machine
"Worst flagship device,  not supporting 5G Had worst experience after pre-order. Found so many issues within 12 hours of delivery to Amazon and Samsung teams. Had to struggle for replacement but could not get. Even visited service centre, service technicians but of no use as corporate team of Chennai refused to acknowledge the issue. And saying as per company policies we can't do anything as per comapny. Wasted more than 10 hrs with Samsung call centre technicians, corporate office as well as regional head office. Everyone thinks that they are CEO of company. Lost all benefits of pre-order of the flagship. Be careful while buying this device.  If I had an option of giving -5 then would have -5 @stars. Worst experience with Samsung, I am lucky that Amazon giving me refund at least. Exchanged the working device and now left with nothing in hand."
"S23 vs Iphone 13 Body: s23 feels good in hand without caseBattery: iphone kingDisplay: s23, color auto bright is wow.Back Color: Hate both so dull in real.Camera: iphoneCharging: both flopHaptics: iphoneVolume: iphoneHeater: s23Gaming: iphone (literally zero lag)Bloatware: samsung king of bloatware which cant be uninstalled.S23 is over priced in my opinion given the features it provides. I got iphone 13 for 48k  flipkart festive sale.Amazon please improve delivery speed in North east. 12day delivery omg.Update: Minus 1 star, My friend bought s23 Ultra for 76000rs in DubaiUpdate 2: Minus 1 star, I have bananagate problem"
Finger print and face unlock bad Face unlock and finger print scanner is bad even oppo vivo is much better then this mobile in low price.
"nice phone with good features camera is very good, with different gestures and image quality is too fine. other things are also very good ."
Phone is just awesome Phone is good but I am disappointed that I didn't got the offer of watch + buds for 5000 rs

 I ordered s23 plus and it came with the torn package but the product is working good. I dont know wheather the seller tried to sell a used one ."
Sim slot not working One of the sim slots is not working ....had run around service center...
Nice compact mobile but camerasare not that great Mobile is good very compact and stylish earlier i had iphone 13 shifted to this expecting cameras will be good my friends s21 ultra cameras are good but these are not that great expected a little more same as 13 battery is okay lasts a day for a normal user software experience is good no lags no problems till now
Worst Battery Life! Battery sucks!iPhone any day has better battery backup. The battery drains even when not using the phone.I regret switching from Apple to Samsung.I hope they fix this with new update.
"Power Button is not working after 25 days of usage. Power button has now stopped working, it's so disgusting that a phone from Samsung that belongs to flagship S series has such quality control issues. Even if Samsung replaces it for free, the integrity of my device is lost. I feel disgusted that I spent 68k on a phone that has such pathetic quality control."
Calling problem(no sound for both side) I face a big problem for this phone.When call sound is not working(not hearing).When I go to the Samsung service sentre they said TRUE caller/any third party aap is the problem.They change software and said not download third party aap.I totaly dissapointed.What I can do?
"Pretty Good compact flagship After a week of usage, It's a beast in terms of performance.Pros:Camera,Improved Battery life,Overall performance,ProcessorCons:Felt lot of Heating issues during setup"
Wrost phone Wrost phone no one buy
"Camera Quality Not Much Good Camera, Overall In This Budget Iphone 13 is Better... Video Quality Avg. And 100x is Only Ai Based... If Your looking Good Flagship.... You should Go with Iphone or s23 only"
"Fake photos of the moon This phone uses Ai to enhance photos of the moon, even if it's not clearly visible. Try clicking a blur image of the moon on another phone and focus this phone on that image."
Blur image Not worth
"Compact & powerful smartphone Pathetic battery life, fingerprint sensor fails at least twice out of 10times.I had to sell my S23 back which I bought it from Samsung shop directly.Not recommended"
Amazon fraud exchange offer Amazon is making a fool of people by fraud exhange offer. Mobile is 100 💯 good must but don't buy from Amazon.
"Wholesome experience!! There's nothing to say anything specific,everything top-notch!!Customization that the one ui provides is everything you could ask for!The one con i felt was that there is no inbuilt app lock in this phone, which is a very basic feature."
You can also try xiaomi 13 pro because now his UI is very fast and looking gorgeous😍 It's ui like a cartoon I didn't like this and also it's looking oldest ever so i didn't prefer 😊
Worst product and service ever Experienced. Poor product and extremely poor service from Amazon Tech support team.Nobody visited to check the product defects.Online trouble shooting and asked for service charges.
"Great quality with few hiccups Pros : lightning speed processor, all apps load and install very quickly, great camera quality front and back, even in tube light environment.Cons1. All notification icons showing same colour, icons not showing the real app colour.2. Mobile got heated up when connected  to TV with smart view for longer durations ( while playing videos).3. When I am playing a video using smart view on TV, I am unable to forward or rewind or pause using my TV remote. I got no control.Again I need to take my mobile to do all these things..Whereas my previous generation mobiles are not like that.."
Best top tier value for money high end smartphone This is easily the best high end flagship phone in the world currently. Also it is Value for money phone. S23 is the best deal of all for most of the people who don't want to buy s23 ultra as it packs all the same bells and whistles like an S23 ultra. Just the difference is of size and camera. Other wise This is the best phone.Very high quality and premium build by samsung.Because of snapdragon This device and software works like charm and super awesome.I would highly recommend this to anybody over any other smartphone.
Exchange Scam Phone is great but amazon exchange program is a scam. Don't ever buy with exchange offer.
Heating issue Phone temperature goes up to 46 degree Celsius at normal uses. My 15000 phone has better heat management...
"Perfection Been using samsung flagships since S7. S23 Ultra is the most refined flagship Samsung has ever made. It got better in areas like performance, camera, battery life, RAM management compared to S22U.Small improvements in design like flatter side rails makes it much easier to handle.Overall a great phone if money isn't the limiting factor."
Perfectly imperfect compact flagship Been using for one and half months. Upgraded from a xiomi smartphone and this delivers especially in software department.BIG fan of the telephoto camera.OIS is exceptional when recording video.The battery life really holds up for its size and needn't say more about the display. Could have added 10bit colour support .There seems to be some issue related with the auto brightness after the April update and the phone is slightly warmer than before even when doing light tasks.Those wishing for prolonged gaming should stay away from this phone.Best 75k I've spent in a long time.
"A great buy! 😍🥰 The media could not be loaded.
                



 See all hidden features on youtube for this dope phone, no features lack in it, great choice over Iphone. Using from few weeks only facing problem with face lock. Else every thing is ideal."
"Best premium segment phone I am S23 plus user, trust me there are no heating issues. Phone usually heats when you buy for 1st few days as the OS self learns your usage pattern but then it doesn't do that any more. OS is smooth to use and camera is awesome. I had iPhone 13 which I exchanged for this phone and the camera is better in the s23 plus."
The best samsung phone since Note 10 There are no issues on this phone. Battery backup is great and the phone refuses to heat.It would be great if the size gets reduced to 6.6 inches
Best Mobile and compact after long time excellent battery backup Best Mobile and compact after long time excellent battery backup more than 1 day with 9.30 hrs of SOT Display no chance compared with all flagships the best and battery backup also after S8 Plus this is best after long time samsung phone never crossed SOT of 7 hrs now getting 9.30 to 10 hrs is what I like and camara one of the best for day to day useage over clock speed heats a bit in heavy useage
Good mobile Best buy value for money good camera quality storage is also more. fine design with good color and processor is best
"Please separate the reviews for S23 and S23 Ultra Dear Amazon, please separate the reviews for S23 and S23 Ultra. They're totally different phones.Upgraded my OP7 Pro to Galaxy S23 Ultra after 4 years of usge. S23 Ultra is simply the best smartphone in the market right now. Batter lasts about a day and half with continuous screen time (non gaming). Cameras are the best in class, second to an iphone 14 pro only in the case of videos. Samsung One UI is the best so far, no hanging or heating issues. SPen is a great addon to business users like me.Cons are, slightly bigger in size, one handed operation is difficult."

Camra Nice camera shots samsung beats all over smartphones in the market. Just go for it it really works fine and amazing
Good Allrounder but a bit pricy Leaves nothing that you want more ..battery excellentCamera excellent..screen awesome .. processor lightning..except for the price seems a bit high..and those who don't like big size mobiles ...there seems to be no other issues ..iPhone takes natural pics ..pictures are excellent but slightly processed compared to apple or pixel...

"Camera shutter lag is very high ..🤯 Mobile is very good. Screen quality is awesome.Performance is perfect.Overall camera quality it top notch. No problem with photo quality at allThere os only on major problem with camera is shutter lag.Capturing moving subject, kids or animal is almost imposible. Most of the time photos will be blurred, shaky and useless.In low light even very small movement will cause shaky pics.Samsung need to to fix shutter lag issue."

Good performance. But...Over heat issue....we can't use 1hr continue...too high heating issue Heating issue...good performance..but heating issue...we can't use continue 1hr ...Due to heavy heat..we need rest for cooling..everything ok..but over heat
"Compact size or features. Decide what you need Wanted a phone like iphone 13/14 (basic) as the size is not 6.5 or 6.7"". I wanted a 6"" -6.1"" phone.So iPhone or Samsung. Wife is having an iphone13 and everything is great except ""TrueCaller"" ! I am an avid truecaller user and I need that for my business and iphone was out of my league.So got samsung s23 8gb/256GB . Amazon worries too much about exchange and finally they couldnt deliver. Had to buy from elsewhere.Phone heats a lot during initial setup.  Now when i use it for 20-30 minutes (like video application), it heats. That is why a star less . Battery is okay. At the end of the day it comes to 15 percent with only calls and apps (banking, browsing etc).Positives  : Feels premium. Yes you can feel it is 50k + Phone the moment you hold it.  CREAM color is a great option.Camera quality is awesome. Even the front camera selfies are great. Wife liked better than her iphone.Handy and Compact. You can use with one hand. You dont feel like a big bar !Fingerprint: It was great till i fixed a tempered glass. After that it is kind of hit and miss unless tried couple of times.Over all - I liked it .If you want an android phone with 6.1"" screen with a good camera  - Go ahead without any second thoughts.Or if you are not worried about android and love iphone  - Go for iphone.Good Luck"
"The real flagship. First of all looks are killer. Second thank god it ha sa flat screen not edge like all other flagships in the market right now. Third camera qualuty super i shifted from i phn 12 pro to this. I was nervouse because i run online business. And now i feel blessed to have ut changed. Battery backup much nuch much better than my prsvious phone i am a heavy user. Almost whole day i am on wnatsapp or insta. Than a small but considearbel surprise is the watch4. I had apple watch and really got sad to change it as i shifted ot anrdoid. But within 15 days i have got used to for the samsung watch4 which comes along with me s23 plus for just 3000.Overall very satisfied with the size, performance, camera, looks evrything. No complaints by now"
"Well it should be titled as a *Perfect Android Phone* I was previously using OnePlus Nord, so it was a big upgrade for me. When I got the phone for almost one week the phone was heating a lot and the battery backup was also not great may be the phone was adapting my using pattern. After a month the phone didn't heat at all ( Using in standard mode not on light mode ) and also I turned on the 85% battery limitations, I noticed that from 85 to 75 the battery was draining really fast and had to charge twice a day. So, I'm disappointed with the battery backup as big tech reviewers where claiming all day battery backup. If I talk about camera performance no doubt one of the best camera on Android even in low light, I don't have any complaints about the camera, 3x protrait give images like DSLR's and the images are really sharp and crisp.Performance on this phone is great. The optimization of Snapdragon 8gen 2 with One UI is really good, animation gives smooth experience.One bug I faced on YouTube (  don't know if it exists with other ) is that sometimes the video starts shuttering in between for milli seconds and it happens many times. I also updated it to the latest version but it didn't solved the problem, might be a problem from YouTube or Samsung don't know.Conclusion :- I you have budget then go for it definitely, you will never regret."
"You gotta own it to believe it A little backstory, I was using a poco f1 for over 4 years and it never disappointed me. Amazing performance, great battery life but the only issue I had was the size and weight of the phone.I wanted a small and compact flagship and the only option I had was the s22. I even went to purchase it but thankfully my card didnt work and transaction didnt go through. So I preordered the s23 through the samsung store and got it for 65000. I have never been more happier than my purchase. Amazing feel in hand, great battery life, easily lasts a day.. many people dont understand how battery life works, this has been nothing short of phenomenal.. everything is great, snappy performance, great speakers , not a photographer but photos are okay.. dont trust the negative comments about heating or battery life."
"Great Phone, but check if your's is a faulty unit. Like everyother reviews all over, there's no doubt it's a great Phone. Compact and powerful. Since I received the phone, it has been blogging me with wifi issues. No matter what, it never achieves my connected speed of 200Mbps+. My previous phone Xiaomi lite ne 5g got 200+ every single time. No matter what I try (reset, updated, reset the router, tested with different router) the wifi speeds only reach half of my connected speed even if I stand right next to the router. I tested with wifi 6 devices half the price of this and they all work perfectly with full speed ( 240 Mbps). I reported the issue to Amazon and they arranged an executive to do an inspection which I later cancelled since I didn't want to go through another reset/wait for a new phone as this is my primary phone. I takes so much time to setup the phone again like you want after a reset and I have painfully done it several times already. Send reports to Samsung and they are still giving me generic replies (restart phone, update, reset) and make me feel like I'm talking to a bot. (Even send them wireless log screenshot from my router). When you spend this kind of money for a flagship phone, you expect better experience at least from the company. I am tired at this point and might just purchase from a local store next time because of my experience."
"Best compact device I am using this phone from past 2 weeksDisplay:best in class,its very sharp and bright and colors look amazing even better than s23 plus ,i saw s23 plus display i can say s23 display is more sharp and clear than s23 plus and you'll love watching content on this device😍.Sound:speakes are awesome clear and loud.Design:its design is really awsome.If you are looking for compact and lightweight phone you definitely buy this.In hand feel:In hand feel is awesome.i actually want to buy this device when i grab this phone for first time,it feels soPremium.Battery: coming from lg g8x ,initially am very doubtful about it's battery but after using it 2 3 days I can say it's battery is great ,it will give you 1 day considering 120hz display with 1750 nit peak brightness ,easily depends on usage.Camera:camera quality is very nice.picture quality is sharp and looks amazing.Video quality is awesome,video stability is even better than iphone 14."
"True Android flagship with a phenomenal battery The media could not be loaded.
                



 Upgraded from S22 Ultra.1. Excellent slab phone. Samsung galaxy flagships defines the android experience not even pixel. IMHO.2. Amazing Camera system. Versatile is the only word which can correctly describes it.3. Phenomenal battery life. Easily two days battery. For very heavy usage will last one day for sure.4. Thermals are maintained well. Never crosses 36°C even with gaming. Only if we shoot 4K, it goes 40°C. Used outdoor in 5G and it ran cool as cucumber5. Great haptics. Implementation is beautifully done6. Beautifully display and premium design7. Call quality, wifi antennas,  5G antennas are good. No complaints8. S pen is an addiction. If you dont need, you can forget the existence but its super useful especially if you are a designer.If you have the money, go ahead."

It's poco m2 phone. Better than iphone Or samsung phones in camera and also gaming under 10000 rs. 
"Flagship Purchase I moved out of the Chinese-phones fold for the first time since my Nokia Lumia 1320. Have been a user of the Le ECOs, Redmi Notes, Honor Lites, and most recently OnePlus Nord (OG). Initially, I was rooting for the 1+ 11 (I know that's Chinese too, but it's tempting) , but then it went wireless-less and all sorts of cost cutting. Did not find it VFM at 62 grand, plus the brand value is still nowhere before Samsung. That brought me to either S23 or iPhone 14. Decision making came easy coz I have a host of galaxy-android ecosystem devices like the galaxy watch, buds, android tab, and the list goes on. Had I opted iPhone, i would have to shun these out of the window in terms of connectivity. Hence, the S23!Hardware wise, the phone is very handy, slides inside my back pocket without flashing it's bottom out, makes one hand use easy. Use-Ex wise, the UI is quite engaging, even though it comes with it's own set of bloatwares. Nothing beats the Oxygen OS though, IMO (R.I.P). The camera takes very good pictures under broad daylight. Night shots are kinda grainy, but with ample light, it does deliver. Battery was a shocker for me. My 1+ drained battery like there was no tomorrow, however this phone relieves me from my recharge-recharge anxiety. One charge lasts more than a day, without breaking a sweat. Wireless works great, reverse wireless works great. Only missing is the fast charging. Knot-to-100 with a 25W adapter takes about 1hr15mins, whereas WARP 30W did it in under 40mins. That's a major missing! I do own a 15W Spigen wireless charger, which takes about 3hrs5mins to fully juice up. Although you could go to the moon and be back by that time, it did cost me 1/8th the price of Samsung wireless pad. Plus I can recharge other wireless devices on it without a hickup. So yeah, to the moon and back doesn't sound that bad. Haptics are decent, stereo speakers are decent. The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is fast, like really fast. 👍 (Please note, if you are slapping a tempered scratch resistant glass onto the touchscreen, you got to re-register your fingerpints. That's just how the ultrasonic work.)All in all, it was an expensive, yet satisfying purchase for me. Software update wise, I am sorted till 2027, at least. Maybe I'll move into the plus or ultra category in my next purchase of Galaxy S27 or whatever Samsung would call it. 😉 (Or maybe not 😜)"
"Camera Quality is worst. Worst Camera Quality not worth of 80k phone.Most of the times when i click pictures some of the part in picture either at top,bottom, or at middle appears to be blurry that to at so much excent that you cant even clearly see whats in the picture.Even cheap phone will have better camera quality then these phone.Fells like have wasted 80k on these phone."
High price I don't know why price is above 1000$ why tell us why to buy this phone no 1 tb memory
Worst phone I purchased it on 21.02.2023. The battery is not charging with cable. Only wi fi charging. Charging is very slow only upto 85%.Samsung Service Centre is not able to fix it. Neither they are providing replacement.
"A Complete package I have been a note user since Galaxy note 1 and kept on upgrading to next note series every year (except Note 7). Only 3 different phones I used that we're not note series One plus 5T, S7 edge and S21 ULTRA. I also carry one iphone with me iPhone 13 pro max for now.Unfortunately Samsung always tried to deceive us with their exynos powered phones which were actually a terrible choice but we had no choice. This year I was to upgrade to one plus 11 if S23 didn't have snapdragon that they did. I got this from local Samsung store with earbuds and galaxy watch 4 promo.Pros:1. Most noticeable change is battery life VS S21 powered by exynos almost double  battery time from S21 ULTRA.2. S pen is ways a boon for fast work and creators.3. Camera has huge improvement compared S21 ULTRA though the difference will be noticed if u r a pro photographer.4. brightness is good but not too good when out in the sun.5. dolby atoms sound is good when ON while watching movies and TV shows .6. Snapdragon 8 gen 2 is cool and no heating issue so far.Cons:1. Price tag should be under 100K .2. Not much display improvement from S21.3. Fast charging could be faster as top flagship phones now support upto 100W charging.4. Long way for snapdragon to beat iPhone processors. Even A14 beats snapdragon in some benchmarks.5. So many Samsung bloatwares that u can't uninstall.Overall it is a good experience and flawless performance."
Heating issue Camera screen everything  is excellent  but there is a severe  heating  issue on this phone and it's like an inferno.
Costliest Iron box ever I bought this phone 5days ago. Very much excited about the camera features mainly. Phone gets heated up immediately within 2mins even in the AC room. Very disappointed with the purchase..
If u bought this phone then no need of Iron box I bought this phone 5days ago. Very much excited about the camera features mainly. Phone gets heated up immediately within 2mins even in the AC room. Very disappointed with the purchase.
"Exchange of mobile purchase don't work I ordered this phone with a mobile exchange and it doesn't worked since the delivery attempts are made at 10PM, felt exhausted."
"Screen Quality Very poor Screen became blackish from corner with no resolution from Samsung, they dont care customer concern and and make very cheap  screen , would suggest not buy."
good phone with very high price its a android - but priced like iphone. iPhone is way better.samsung phones will drop price 30% by 1/2 monthand laggy interface

 The BEAST of the phones!!! After using note 9 since 5 years!!! I use macbook14 airpods 3 and brought an iphone couple of months ago! I can't complain about mac or airpods! But Believe me samsung flagships are far better, far superior than an iphone, especially these latest galaxy ultra series, these are just beast!!! You can't do so many things on iphone, worst dialer, worst calculator, worst map... so many... tonns of problems on an iphone!!! You can't make an iphone your main device except showing of your money power to buying the highest priced phone!!! You gonna get only that satisfaction!!!!Samsung and Galaxy s23 ultra is just killing the market! Great battery life! Brilliant camera! Superior display and calling quality!! Just go for it!Don't avoid the watch 4 classic! Believe me that's the added surprise if you've never used any smartwatch before! I had a samsung galaxy watch regular 4 44 mm. But this classic lte!!!!! Boss just experience it!!! This is some thing great at this price!!!Buds 2 are superb!! They gonna do their job very respectfully, Don't think about buds pro 2, these are enough!!!🔞The only huge and great disappointment for me is the weight of the phone!!!This is thick, this is huge, this is too heavy!!!100% not for kids and chapris...I brought it from reliance digital at the price of around 119000 rupees for the 256gb phone smart watch and the buds!You have to pay the double price of this for buying the same for an iphone iwatch and airpods!!!Still you not gonna be able to even pause while video recording or voice recording! Lol!🤣"
"it is just an hype... not an exceptional phone at all Hello Everyone...This review I'm writing on basis of some true facts and thinking... and please consider it to be my own personal thoughts...I buyed this phone from Samsung wesite with exchange to my iphone 12 and with  all discounts i got it for 70 k 8/256 GB cream(white variant)1- This phone price is kept at  80k.. I believe at this price point 2k display i.e. 1440px display should be there  ... at this point many people will say that our eyes can see only 390ppi but thats not correct... in S9+ and in that era Samsung used to give approx 565ppi which used to look so fantastic and crisp... on the name of which Samsung is still filling its stomach in the name of good display... but to be true... its if not similar ,then its closer to any other cheap amoled smartphone out there.. I've used LG g7 thinq , s9+ with some great crisp displays and these technicalities a normal user wont understand...2- Yess while holding it feels premium... but not different... try to mark my words... not different... the 2nd person cannot even guess which phone you are having... after all you spent 80k and still the people are not able to identify .. this feels like what's the difference b/w when i'm holding some other 20k android phone or this 80k samsung s23 with 3 camera setup.3- Display being amoled in night times sting in eyes... but it did ever happened with my iphone 12 or past 11 or even 7 or SE(2016)4- Display sometimes flickers,,,, I'm not sure if  it is happening due to high refresh rate..5- To be true there is no such innovation between a 20 k phone or 80 k phone... better have 20k phone and buy a go pro in the rest money... that would be more benificial..6- Battery - the hype which they were showing in the review videos that due to 8gen 2 SD the battery efficiency has been increased... there is no such case.... it dont even lasts for a complete day with normal usage...7 - Everyone knows this phone is gonna be at some 40k in few months... so there will be no value of the phone after even 3-4 months...I brought this point because i sold my iphone 12 which i bought 128GB varient for 55k in big billion 2021 oct.. and i got approx 40k(39780/-) for the phone in exchange...8- the finger print... it is inaccurate most of the timesAt this price point the phone is not justified.This is just the brand value made on the name of which the smartphone is getting sold.At this price point iphone 13 256 GB or iphone 14 128GB is totally justified with yes the boring but stable OS,with less flaws and no cheap feeling and totally justified for the price.... its like untill you dont experience you don't understand the difference..."
"The Best Overall Phone I bought S23 Ultra from Samsung Shop app using pre-order.I have used this for 2 weeks now and oh boy, what an experience.Top notch screen, with a great UI customization experience. I just can't stop looking at the screen colors. What a heart warming experience.Great camera and, eventually the first Android smartphone that beats the Apple i14 Pro max in some areas in videography as well, along with photography. Much battery selfie and main camera than S22 Ultra.NO Overheating even with prolonged usage. It might get warm but then stays there.Fun to use product with S-pen and loads of functionality. Great battery life for the display size and doesn't get heated much even after prolonged intensive usage.Great Bixby assistant, now at same level as Google Assistant, and in some ways better when it comes to phone settings that google assistant can't reach.Awesome loud and wholesome speakers, even better than 14 pro max. May be a little less loud but definitely overall quality is better.Special gaming mode where you can directly connect to charger without involving battery.Premium all-around.What could have been better - 3X zoom lens could have been better - it still can be if Samsung can combine the 10MP shot pixels with 200/50MP pixels for great 3-10X zoom range. Some phone have bugs like Bixby text call is not working for some or Bixby On-Device English app needs to be fixed for On Device mode.But nothing that hinders the overall experience. Overall the best Android in the market - slick and sharp that eventually according to me beats iPhone 14 pro max. Buy the 512 GB version if you want the best out of camera.Note - This is not a paid sponsored review. You can check my other reviews as well."
"Got S23 ULTRA in Rs.95500 with the SBI offer. The media could not be loaded.
                



 Got this in Rs.95500/- using 10% OFF with the SBI card offer link at https://amzn.to/3KYCy41Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra 5G is the latest smartphone that has left tech enthusiasts in awe. It comes in a green color with 12GB RAM and 256GB internal storage. The device is equipped with a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, a 108MP camera, and a 5000mAh battery.The camera quality is excellent, the battery life is great as well. I am getting around 10 hours SOT, and 24 hours total time in a full recharge.OneUI is one of the best Android experiences you can get.Pros:1. The camera quality is exceptional with great detail and clarity.2. 5G network support allows for high-speed internet access.3. The device comes with a large 6.8-inch screen, making it perfect for multimedia consumption.4. It has an ultra-fast processor that can handle any task with ease.5. The battery life is impressive and can last a whole day with moderate usage.6. The 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking and swift app launch.7. The storage capacity is ample for storing all your media files and documents.8. The device has an elegant design with a premium feel.9. It supports wireless charging and reverse wireless charging.10. The device has great security features like an under-display fingerprint scanner and facial recognition.Cons:1. The device is quite expensive.2. The camera module protrudes from the back and can be a bit awkward to handle.3. The device is quite heavy and bulky.4. The green color option may not be to everyone's liking.5. The device doesn't have a headphone jack, so you have to use a dongle or wireless headphones.At last, I would like to say, the Samsung S23 Ultra is the best mbl till date from the company. Its UI is very fast & smooth. The camera is improved from before. The heating issue is not at all felt after using the mbl. The battery is just great, having SOT of around 7-8 hours with mixed usage. S Pen is another thing we would love very much which is the same as S22 Ultra. Design-wise no changes except for more flatter screen."
"Monster! The best device I ever bought. I was using S20 before and this is a huge upgrade.Capture moon, spiders, beautiful sceneries and everything you can imagine of. This phone keeps your phone temperature as cool as MSD and performs like Rocky Bhai and gives a battery life like Dravid batting. Let me make it easy for you.Pros:1. Display: Samsung manufactures 85%+ Amoled displays across the world. They never compromise on this. LTPO 3.0 is a game changer, which uses far less battery and adapts refresh rate pretty well. Edge is less curvy this time for all good reasons.2. Camera: Even though we don't use 200MP and 100x zoom in Normal occasions, this device is facing one of the best smartphone camera. You can take Astro photography, night photography, moons look a lot better, colour corrections are great. Expert RAW mode added and supports a lot of tweakings.3. Battery: Man, I never thought Samsung could get their battery correct. My previous experience with Samsung battery life was bad. This phone delivered the best battery life and optimal heat management along with it. I get 10-11 hours screen on time on one full charge.4. Performance: butter smooth. Feels more fluid. Never faced hangs.5. Design and body strength: I met with an accident 3 days before. The device was on my pocket. I got injured, but thankfully new S23 Ultra didn't give any ""accidental shock""! Strong body and glass.6. Speakers: Loud, clear and better than iphone 14 pro speakers. Never faced diffraction.7. Future updates: 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of support!! What else you need? Imagine getting Android 17 when S27 gets released.8. Mobile receptors: Improved, fast and good quality mobile receptors are used. Normally, there is very less network in my home, but this device gives a better network than other devices.9. Goodlock: You can customize almost most of the UI elements. themes, buttons, S-pen menu, home UI, shortcuts and AOD...Cons:1. Charging speed: 25W charger takes 70 min to fully charge this device, whereas 45W takes 60 min. Only 10 min difference between their so-called ultra fast charger.2. S-pen: Though S pen is great, who uses it much? The screen is small to write anything meaningful. I wish they add more battery by removing S-pen. (No problem with battery, but the space for s-pen could be used for other good purposes)3. Haptic feedback: Not complaining, but I enjoyed S20 haptic feedback more than this one's.4. Weight: this one feels heavy in your hand. Maybe because I am coming from S20, a smaller device.5. Requires some time to get used to a lot of good features available on this device. Goodlock, battery optimizations, camera and many other settings and configurations. Not a con, but only a few uses its full potential.Who should buy this?A person who can afford, wants the best overall Android smartphone in the market and wants it to last more than 3-4 years.I chose this phone against Iphone 14 pro max. I hope phone delivers."
DEFAULT VERTICAL GREEN LINES IN GALAXY S20 S21 S22 S23 AFTER OUT OF WARRANTY! What i should do ? I am getting many vertical green lines. After 2 yrs of buying automatically getting these hardware problem.with every update it gets increases and increases covering the screen. The bad quality Samsung product. Total waste of money. They are really  not taking responsibilities just ignoring by saying some tiny tiny dents on back of mobile. It's not related to that. It's obvious software update fault. If anyone getting this please report to consumer helpline app. Explain them properly they will help you to some extent.One more thing the back cover is pasted with gum. check! your little pull will take it off.highly disappointed at these kind of quality fault by samsung.
Upgrade from s9+ to s23+ Upgrade from s9+ to s23+Super coolFastFlat screenBattery backupBit thick compared with s9+Overall nice phone✌️😁😁
"Compact and sensible smartphone The Samsung Galaxy S23 is an excellent choice for anyone who's looking for a one-handed and compact smartphone. The ease of using with one hand and the screen area available for use is just about right.I have listed some points from my usage after 2 months of use - it involves everything except gaming.What's good about the device?1. Communications - Network reception is really good. It is very power efficient in 4G mode with SOT more than 8 hours.Wifi, NFC, casting, Samsung DeX- all of these work reliably well.5G Communication is also excellent but the SOT with active 5G use drops to around 6 hours.2. Display - it is good, but it would have been even better if the panel would have been the same from S23 Ultra.3. Battery life - excellent with normal usage. With calls, 4G and WiFi, and lots of streaming, it easily lasts a day. SOT of 9-10 hours can be obtained quite easily when connected to WiFi. On 5G network, obviously it'll drop off a bit.4. Performance - Excellent so far. No issues whatsoever.5. Samsung Pay - excellent features, easy to use, and I don't need to carry my wallet anymore.6. Camera - takes excellent pictures. Even the night mode works very well.What's not so good?1. Charger is missing in the box. OEMs who actually care about sustainability should not copy Apple (or others) and it's ridiculous decisions.2. Display - sometimes the display seems unresponsive in various apps. Although it is easily fixed by switching between apps or worst case, restarting the app. Not sure if it is hardware related or app related. Not all apps have this issue.When it happens, it's quite annoying."
